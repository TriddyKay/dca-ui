  The members took a long drive out to Templestowe where a local Carlucci’s waiter named Gramblin told Triz about a spooky temple named Rahjbog. He referred to it as the temple of doom due to its hidden presence and camera filled dining area (nothing gets unnoticed).<br>
  <br>
  It must also be noted that this is the first time Dinner Club has travelled west down the culinary silk road, to the land of colours and spices, India! Though the expedition was adventurous, the ordering was not, butter chicken and garlic naan all round (apart from Nick who had vindaloo and some tictoc crackers for entrée).

The cutlery and plates showed a real authentic Asian twist to an entitled suburban environment that Richmond usually has to offer.
The food was above average, with a quality pork belly but a not so quality braised fuck. 
Another issue that I didn't really enjoy was how they served duck on duck.

Upon entering we were informed we only had until 7:30 to eat. 
This proved to not be an issue as the service was very fast. Well done on your quick juicy dumpers.

The muscular blonde man sitting opposite me seemed to be pleasantly surprised with the juicy dumpers on offer at I Love Dumplings also;
Although without labeled vinegar and soy sauce, the muscular man buggered up his mixture. He was very upset.

  Some Friday night complications caused a schism in dinner club seeing, Tridda heading out for his own adventures 
  with Nick and Christian joined by Mikka and Bas who proved to be great guest diners at Empress of China. 
  </br>
  </br>
  Upon entering we decided to conduct a pre-dinner assessment of the restaurant and is as follows:
  </br>
  Political – 2/10. Absolute chaos, no semblance of authority
  </br>
  Environmental – 4.5/10. Poor air quality, decent water quality and clean table with minimal stick.
  </br>
  Technological – 2/10. Issues with the ancient Fujitsu AC, appears to not have worked since 2011, clearly fake LCD TV, functioning fridge
  </br>
  Economic – 9/10. Excellent value, only $22 per head included corkage
  </br>
  Legal – 4/10. Food safety issues, pays of council, seems to have all the paperwork in place but clearly doesn’t comply with emergency evacuation legislation.
  </br>
  </br>
  Overall the food was good but nothing to write a postcard about, lets give it a 6/10. Special mention must be made to the deconstructed lemon chicken, 
  which left the lemon sauce aside from the chicken. As someone who generally despises Gatorade chicken, the fact the chicken wasn’t soggy, and the sauce 
  was quite light made it tolerable. Will be back. Reluctantly.

  In contrast to yet another cold and wet Friday night, Dinner Club’s taste buds were transported to tropical South East Asia, where we were treated to some delectable Thai.</br>
  </br>
  Christian ‘Pad Simi Ew’ Simitzis, once again demanded we get him the Chicky Chicky Pad See Ew just to tickle his sick Pad See Ew needs. He later admitted he has never once 
  tried any other Thai dish in his life. The devilish grin on his face as he ate was quite sickening, however, his recommendation was spot on and paired exceptionally 
  well with their Roti and Satay Sauce. Trust me that roti with satay wine and dined me but didn’t fuck me at all.</br>
  </br>
  Other dishes of note included the Masaman Curry and the Tom Yum Soup, which nourished not only my body, but my soul. Good use of spice but I feel like they toned it 
  down as I’m sure in the past many Aussies have complained about it being “too bloody spicy”. Only issue was the mains took too long and made me finish my entire bottle 
  of wine early.</br>

  This week took us Parma Fridays down at the Vale but we were, unfortunately, a man down as Panini D Dragon had a zorba circle 
  to attend to with his work colleagues. In his absence, Michael Jordan joined the gang for a Parma and Pint combo meal deal which 
  was amazing value. Parms were a bit cheesy and lacked napoli sauce but still good for its buck!
  </br>
  </br>
  We requested Jager bombs to give us some life energy for the night’s festivities. 
  Unfortunately, this left the young bartender embarrassed because she didn't know how to make a Jager bomb and shocked 
  that these men would even consider a 7.30 pm bomb in front of a room full of families just finishing entrees. 
  $15 ea. for the bombs which is just ridiculous.</br>

  To celebrate the last night of the work year, a Dinner Club favorite, Tao Dumplings in South Yarra was chosen. 
  The 43 degree night proved too much for Mr. Kay, who opted to stay at home until sundown.<br/>
  The heat also played havoc with Christian’s Uber, causing a 30 minute delay. This left Gus and myself to order, with many dumplings, 
  Peking duck rolls, veggie noodles and Chinese greens selected for our banquet.<br/>
  <br/>
  The food was a smash hit as per usual, however the wine pairing was a bit of a miss.
  Nick’s Riesling was well received but the warm Shiraz was a struggle to get down. None the less, nothing went to waste and we left satisfied, though a little sweaty. 
  Merry Christmas from all of us at Dinner Club adventures, I hope everyone enjoys their Christmas feasts!<br/>

  A wet and windy Friday night saw us at the Shanghai Dragon Dumpling House, a name plucked right from 
  a Chinese restaurant random name generator. None the less, with Shiraz in hand, we were excited to 
  see what culinary delights they had to offer. We were also joined by several of our favorite guest 
  diners, which created a jovial atmosphere. It is also worth noting that this is the only Chinese 
  restaurant I’ve been to which has had not one, but two TVs showing the cricket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pork dumplings were very nice however we were shocked to find that the Xiao Long Bao, 
  which we all excited for, lacked any soup inside and were not the slightest bit juicy. 
  The dishes that followed were equally disappointing. The BBQ Pork Belly should’ve been named the 
  Sahara Desert Pork Belly and the Kung Po Chicken was way too sweet. The only redeeming dish was 
  the Beef with Oyster Sauce which had a nice peppery kick to it. Rob’s sweet and sour soup also 
  tasted like they just got a ladle and scooped out the dishwater and served it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, fun time with friends but we all expected more from the food. Hot tip, put some bloody soup in your Xiao Long Bao!

  A VERY hot Friday night brought us to Viet Star down near Lord Simitzis' ol’ university stomping ground and Panini D Dragon’s 
  electrical pangolier study days. Once Dragon hopped off the Number 16 tram, he realised this was the place where he used to pretend 
  to be a Swinburne student where he would help himself to the university’s facilities at his leisure. This brought Dragon to look like a sweaty man who 
  had just been interrogated hoping no one would be able to recognize him because he actually went to Hogwarts.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the Lord's first Vietnamese experience ever in his 25 years of life so a new milestone to flex about to his work colleagues to really show 
  how diverse his palate really is. The members were accompanied by Rex Hunt, Rizzly Adams, Cal Gadot and Sallalopolous! Ordering was done by Kevin Costner
  this time as Panini D Dragon was still catching his breath at the table. Costner really nailed it, almost like he rehearsed it at home prior…
  <br>
  <br>
  One happy member, Knicky!
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  The entrée to start the night off was a classic deep-fried prawn wantons which were absolutely spot on! The members were in awe, with its sexy oily taste and light 
  sweet chili lighting up our eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mains ordered tonight was the Duck with Plum sauce, Salt & Pepper Calamari and SIZZLING ginger chicken and stir-fried veggies!
  <br>
  <br>
  All were exceptional to the members, although, Dragon and Kevin seemed to dislike the light tang that was accompanied by the Duck and Plum. 
  This is a result of two men who didn't grow up with lemon chicken, a meal that has sculpted billions of palates through its history, but one must start somewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The calamari was a real hoot, with its lightly fried layer which just softly broke when you took your first bite and the sizzling ginger chicken and veg were absolutely 
  juicy and gave us our week’s greens in one sitting. 
  <br>
  <br>
  PS: Rex Hunt ordered a different calamari dish for the starving members, but the staff seemed to have missed his order even though he was the first one? 
  Repeated recitation is a great way for people to remember specific material, being in the hospitality industry, I would recommend this method for 
  anyone trying to woo customers and show off your menu knowledge to your peers. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Hot Tip: Hire a bouncer to watch the door at all times as when it’s a 40 degree night and your blasting 2 Fujitsu's inside. You don’t let your staff leave the bloody 
  door open and let the cool air escape. BO and the aroma of Asian sauces don’t mix.
