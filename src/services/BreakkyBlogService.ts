  A windy saturday morning brunch down at Beans Republique with Kevin Constaner attempting to sit next to me, not across.
  Once again the menu didn't have 'eggs your way', this could be a Stonnington council issue as eggs your way is everywhere 
  in South Yarrakian region. Coffees were a solid 8, took bloody years to come though!
  </br>
  </br>
  Hot tips: when I order a coffee I would like it in t-minus 5 minutes. Maybe fire the barista for ruining my life. 8/10 ill come back.

  The atmosphere at Mr.Foxx was rather pleasant for a Saturday brunch outing, although a few hiccups with the waiter. 
  I, as the customer, had to correct him about one of the most popular items on the meny. It's egg your way, not whatever...
  </br>
  </br>
  A terrible combination of the shakiest table in the world and a battle between a blunt knife and some sourdough ended with coffee 
  flying everywhere against our will. 7/10 coffee needs to be better... maybe fire the barista.

  Once again, we are at the Darling enjoying a great brekky with a slighty tipsy Kevin Costaner (Trid) who really enjoys taytay saturdays(Taylor Swift). Eggs your way was on 
  the menu which was just a delight to see, but going to have to -1 off the score as bread on bread on a small plate is just a bit too difficult to tackle and navigate around.
  </br>
  </br>
  Their vege breakfast is a certainty to cure that saturday morning hang over. </br>
  A plate of great mushrooms, eggs, potato rosti and some classic sourdough put some life back into the cold, dead, dumb, 
  stupid but extremely sexy blue bombshell eyes of Trid.

  9/10 - keep the barista but yet to see anyone finish their kale?

  Great brunch outing this weekend, Moby had the 'eggs your way on toast', yes on toast. We will let it slide!</br>
  It was a solid 7 only because of the mushies.</br>
  Bread was a tad too hard to cut with my knife, leaving me to flex my guns to get into the pesky crust!</br>
  Service was a bit slow but they made up for it with their great knowledge of anatomy and the location of the larynx.</br>
  The mimosas were satisfying, but it was a shock to my ear holes to find out they didn't have Bloody Marys.
